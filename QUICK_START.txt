SlotSwapper - Quick Start Guide
================================

FASTEST WAY TO RUN (Docker)
===========================

1. Make sure Docker is installed and running

2. Run this single command:
   $ docker-compose up --build

3. Open your browser:
   Frontend: http://localhost:3000
   Backend: http://localhost:3001

That's it! 🎉

The application will:
- Start PostgreSQL database
- Run database migrations automatically
- Start the backend server
- Start the frontend server
- Everything will be ready to use!

FIRST TIME USING THE APP
=========================

1. Go to http://localhost:3000

2. Click "Sign up" and create an account
   - Enter your name, email, and password (min 6 characters)

3. You'll be automatically logged in and redirected to the Dashboard

4. Create your first event:
   - Click "Create Event" button
   - Fill in the event details
   - Choose status (BUSY or SWAPPABLE)
   - Click "Create"

5. Make an event swappable:
   - Find a BUSY event
   - Click "Make Swappable"

6. To test swapping (open in incognito/another browser):
   - Create a second user account
   - Create and mark an event as SWAPPABLE
   - Go to "Marketplace" tab
   - You'll see the first user's swappable slot
   - Click "Request Swap"
   - Select one of your swappable slots
   - Click "Send Request"

7. Accept the swap (as the first user):
   - Go to "Requests" tab
   - See the incoming request
   - Click "Accept" to swap the events
   - Both users' calendars will update instantly!

COMMON ISSUES
=============

Port 3000 or 3001 already in use?
- Stop the process using that port, or
- Change ports in docker-compose.yml

Database connection failed?
- Wait a few seconds for PostgreSQL to start
- Check Docker logs: docker-compose logs db

Can't see swappable slots in Marketplace?
- You need at least 2 users
- Each user needs swappable events
- You can't see your own slots

Real-time notifications not working?
- Check browser console for WebSocket errors
- Make sure backend is running on port 3001
- Check that you're logged in

STOP THE APPLICATION
====================

Press Ctrl+C in the terminal, then:
$ docker-compose down

To remove all data (database):
$ docker-compose down -v

MANUAL SETUP (without Docker)
